# Coding Challenge: Backup Tool

## Objective

Build a command line **file backup tool** that can take snapshots of a
directory, storing its contents in a database and supporting incremental
backups. Each snapshot should represent the state of the directory at a given
point in time. The tool should allow the user to restore a copy of the
directory from a snapshot. The tool should also support pruning of old
snapshots without losing data.

## Requirements

- Demonstrate your ability to write robust, professional-grade code to the best
  of your ability.
- Provide *automated* tests that prove the correctness of your implementation.
  These tests should not only exercise the functionality, but also verify
  assertions about it.
- Provide an easy and repeatable way to build, test, and execute your
  implementation on a unix-like system using common, freely-available software.
- Include clear, accurate, and high-quality instructions for setting up and
  using your implementation. This challenge is as much about documentation as
  it is about code.

## Guidelines

- For the purpose of this challenge, focus on the core functionality rather
  than window dressing such as argument parsing or output formatting. The
  mechanics of the operations and the quality of the code/documentation are the
  priority, so you don't need to worry about making the command-line interface
  polished. However, it should still be straightforward to use.
- It is not necessary to support concurrent operation. That is, you may assume
  that all invocations of the tool will be executed one at a time.
- It is not necessary to support backups of large files. You may assume the
  files will be small, and so reading their content into memory is acceptable.

## Operations

### `snapshot`

Takes a snapshot of all files in the specified directory and stores their
content and filenames in a database.

- Only the file contents and filenames are stored as part of the snapshot;
  metadata like permissions, ownership, or timestamps should be ignored.
- Snapshots should store only incremental differences in order to minimize the
  size of the database. That is, the minimal amount of data necessary to
  express the new state of the directory by referencing already-stored data.
- The tool should not store any duplicate file or directory content. Use
  content hashes (such as SHA-256) to detect changes and avoid storing
  duplicate content.
- The database can be a database of any kind, not necessarily involving a
  database management system.
- Snapshots are given a number in sequence based on the order in which they
  were created.

Illustrative example:

    $ backuptool snapshot --target-directory=~/my_important_files

### `list`

Lists snapshots that are stored in the database.

- Snapshots are listed in a table on stdout with the following columns:
  snapshot number, timestamp

Illustrative example:

    $ backuptool list
    SNAPSHOT  TIMESTAMP
    1         2024-09-01 14:35:22
    2         2024-09-02 09:10:45
    3         2024-09-03 16:22:10

### `restore`

Restores the directory state from any previous snapshot into a new directory.

- The tool should recreate the entire directory structure and contents exactly
  as they were at the time of the snapshot.
- Only the files present in the snapshot should be restored.
- All files that were originally shapshotted should be restored.
- The restored files should be bit-for-bit identical to the originally
  snapshotted files.

Illustrative example:

    $ backuptool restore --snapshot-number=42 --output-directory=./out

### `prune`

Removes old snapshots from the database and deletes any unreferenced data.

- The tool should allow the user to prune older snapshots while ensuring no
  data loss from the remaining snapshots.
- After pruning, all remaining snapshots should still be fully restorable.

Illustrative example:

    $ backuptool prune --snapshot=42

## Sanity Checks

Before submitting, double-check that all of these are true of your
implementation. It is recommended to create integration tests to verify these
where possible.

- All files that were originally included in a snapshot are restored when that
  snapshot is restored.
- Restored files are bit-for-bit identical to the originally snapshotted files.
- Pruning a snapshot should not affect the ability to restore a different
  snapshot, even if the pruned snapshot shared data with the other snapshot. An
  unpruned snapshot should always be restorable.
- Your implementation can handle files that contain arbitrary binary content.
- Your implementation can handle relative and absolute file paths robustly.
- When snapshotting a directory twice without changes, the second snapshot
  should only cause storage of metadata, and not result in storage of duplicate
  file content.
- Try getting your project set up and running on a clean system by following
  your own provided instructions. You can use a container or VM to try this.
  The project should be trivial to get running.

## Stretch goals

- Enhance `list` operation to include additional disk-usage metrics, such as:
    - How much disk space the directory consumed at the time of snapshotting
      (i.e. how much space the restored snapshot would require).
    - How much disk space the snapshot actually requires for its distinct file
      content. In other words, how much space is required to store the files
      that are unique to the snapshot. This is the amount of space that pruning
      the snapshot would free up.
    - Total size of the database as a 'summary' line
    - For example:

            $ backuptool list
            SNAPSHOT  TIMESTAMP            SIZE  DISTINCT_SIZE
            1         2024-09-01 14:35:22  432   42
            2         2024-09-02 09:10:45  401   32
            3         2024-09-03 16:22:10  305   37
            total                          501
- Implement a `check` operation that scans the database for any corrupted file
  content.
- Use chunking to de-duplicate storage at a more fine-grained level.
- Come up with your own idea and implement it!
